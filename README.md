### Wall elevation view generator

Ciel is a full-stack, verticalized developer; “The Tesla of Buildings”. We build premium homes and skyscrapers, with the goal of dramatically cut the cost (>30%) and time (50%) to build.

We need your expertise to make it happen.

Your goal in this task is to create a push button “Wall elevation”, that creates an elevation view for all the walls in the model. The elevation marker must be placed in the center of the wall. The far clipping must match the width of the wall. The width and height of the elevation view must match that of the wall. The generated elevation view must clearly show the MEP within each wall.
